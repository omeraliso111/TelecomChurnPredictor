# Telecom Churn Predictor
This is a demo put together to try out training a model using <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow 2.0</a>, transforming it into a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">TensorflowJS</a> model, and serving it in a website. To try it out, enter a customer's information and the model will predict whether that customer will drop your telecom services. The data is based on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">Telco Kaggle Dataset</a>.
